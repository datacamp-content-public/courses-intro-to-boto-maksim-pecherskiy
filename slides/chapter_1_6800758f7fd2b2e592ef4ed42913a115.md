In the last set of exercises, you learned how to list, create and delete buckets.  This will let you create custom containers as part of your data pipeline.  Now that we have these buckets, it's time to put stuff in them.  The files within AWS buckets are called objects.  And an object can really be anything - an image, a video file, CSVs, or log files.  Working with files in S3 is where Boto becomes really useful for your data pipeline work.  Uploading, downloading, and iterating over objects in S3 buckets is a key component of many pipelines.  Let's take a look at how objects work.
